#" " (space):Adds a space character to the list to allow encryption of messages with spaces.
#string.punctuation Contains special characters such as: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~ >>>>
#These symbols are useful for enhancing encryption security.
#string.digits Contains numbers from 0 to 9: 0123456789
#string.ascii_letters:Contains lowercase and uppercase English letters: >>>
# abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
